Sometimes I feel like I'm only pretending to be human.
I look at how little we are and how grand the whole universe is.
One day I could be having a very stressful period and be tunnel visioned on the next step of my own story then, the following day, I would be only thinking about the mysteries of the universe and the Heavens and the Greater Dao that glues all parts of creation together.
