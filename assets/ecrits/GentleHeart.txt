"The thing with the gentle heart is that it whispers. 
To hear what it says and feels, calm and peace of mind are needed."

The desruptive heart, on the other side, is loud.
So loud you can hear it over thunder.

Every soul comprises these two energies ever-dancing together. 

When the soul is scared, you can hear the disruptive heart scream its fear.
When the soul is hurt, the disruptive heart screams its pain and agony.
When the soul is jubilant, no matter where you stand, you will hear the disruptive heart's joy and happiness echo in the distance.
Again and again and again.

Only when the soul is calm can you hear the whispers of the gentle heart.
