Once upon a time, in very different times
A young boy and a story told in more than a few lines
His story is a tale that is yours, his and mine
His story is a tale that would always somehow rhyme

The boy had a fever; One that wouldn't go away
A burning envy to discover every day
In the same place for too long never could he stay
His desire for adventure was all he could obey
 
One day, The Wandering Boy was wandering once more
Through the branches, the high leaves, trees he'd never seen before
The boy was in awe, on the floor was his jaw
That or else he'd be jolly singing lalala 

He met a tree, an ant, saw flowers grow in pair
Under the sun, under the moon he met a little one named Claire
She was signing for a partner, he was looking for what's rare
So they started wandering together in each other's care

New birds, new insects, they saw creatures of all kind
Novelties after novelties would pour inside their minds
The boy would often think : "Ã” World! You are so kind"
But not everything that's new is sweet, he would soon find

In a field not far off, they saw sheep having a meal
Eating grass, eating hay, eating all types of greens
Then all of sudden, there was panic and screams
And the herd left a little one behind who'd never heal

A big, big, hungry wolf was attached to its neck
A sight that Claire and The Wandering Boy wished they'd forget
Claire started crying and the boy did so as well
It was new for him to cry but oh did he not stop there

While she was speechless, the boy on his knees fell
Shouting to the skies louder than Sunday's church bells
He felt betrayed to his essence, down to his core
So he complained and complained like he never did before
