I think it's a necessary thing for a life to end; for humans to eventually die.
And don't get me wrong, extending life sure is great for the individual but I have come to wonder if generally, for the human species itself, it was was such a good idea.
The thought that led to this point is simply the fact that with age, comes a stronger resistance to change. It's gonna happen want it or not. At different speed and intensity sure, but it's gonna happen.
And when you think about time and temporality, the future depends on the past. And every generation remembers a different past.
Thus death erases a past to leave space for a newer one.
For a newer future to happen, it needs to have a newer past.
