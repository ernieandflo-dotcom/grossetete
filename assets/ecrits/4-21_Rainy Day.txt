It had been sunny for a while 
For the whole 40 days 
40 days not one less 
Following every night without rest

And a cloud finally appeared 
In the blue reflecting sky mirror
It made itself known 
And was not coming alone

Trumpet in hand
Blowing as hard as it could 
It was only a vanguard 
Behind, its brothers and sisters

The music started 
The celebrations had begun
One cloud was signing 
A few were clapping 

Their hands were colliding 
And the others were dancing
Fireworks ignited
Festivities at the highest

Then, oh, then
Thunder started chanting 
Loud, very loud
Louder than anything

The parade was jaw dropping
It took only a moment 
Then wine started pouring
Announcing the banquet

Finally. Finally. 
Finally a rainy day!
