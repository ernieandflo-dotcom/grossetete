I have four favorite colors.
Pink. Rebel! I don't know really... it just gives me vibes of rebellion and non-conformity.
Turquoise. Curiosity and mystery or elegance. 
Lilac. Serenity. I think of lilac and find myself surrounded by nature, relaxing, slowing down and connecting with Mother Earth.
Black. All? Nothing? Neither? Both? So many questions and so many answers erupt from this color. As for myself, I would give the color "black" all of the meanings above for it is a very paradoxal color. However, I would also add, for that same reason, "potential" to its list of meanings.
