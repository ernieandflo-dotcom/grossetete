"Life isn't about evading death long enough to live. Life is about choosing how to die and doing it with a smile." 

Ernest G. Bizimana, also known through the stage name Ness Grosse-TÃªte, is a seemingly simple yet rather nuanced individual. Funny and quirky, easy going and always looking like nothing can bother him, he invites you to be part of his journey of fun seeking and internal peace and to embrace the beautiful, powerful and poetic absurdity of existence. In the artistic realm, he is sometimes described as a poet or a writer, other times as a rapper and performer and a few will even say of him that he is primarily a story teller. However, deep down, when you truly get to know him, you will understand that all he really is doing and all he ever wanted to do was to play. Words simply happen to be some of his favorite toys.
