      <h1>(8/21) A Wandering Boy</h1>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, in very different times<br>
        A young boy and a story told in more than a few lines<br>
        His story is a tale that is yours, his and mine<br>
        His story is a tale that would always somehow rhyme
      </p>
      <p>
        The boy had a fever; One that wouldn't go away<br>
        A burning envy to discover every day<br>
        In the same place for too long never could he stay<br>
        His desire for adventure was all he could obey
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, The Wandering Boy was wandering once more<br>
        Through the branches, the high leaves, trees he'd never seen before<br>
        The boy was in awe, on the floor was his jaw<br>
        That or else he'd be jolly singing lalala 
      </p>
      <p>
        He met a tree, an ant, saw flowers grow in pair<br>
        Under the sun, under the moon he met a little one named Claire<br>
        She was signing for a partner, he was looking for what's rare<br>
        So they started wandering together in each other's care
      </p>
      <p>
        New birds, new insects, they saw creatures of all kind<br>
        Novelties after novelties would pour inside their minds<br>
        The boy would often think : "Ô World! You are so kind"<br>
        But not everything that's new is sweet, he would soon find
      </p>
      <p>
        In a field not far off, they saw sheep having a meal<br>
        Eating grass, eating hay, eating all types of greens<br>
        Then all of sudden, there was panic and screams<br>
        And the herd left a little one behind who'd never heal
      </p>
      <p>
        A big, big, hungry wolf was attached to its neck<br>
        A sight that Claire and The Wandering Boy wished they'd forget<br>
        Claire started crying and the boy did so as well<br>
        It was new for him to cry but oh did he not stop there
      </p>
      <p>
        While she was speechless, the boy on his knees fell<br>
        Shouting to the skies louder than Sunday's church bells<br>
        He felt betrayed to his essence, down to his core<br>
        So he complained and complained like he never did before
      </p>
